      <h1>Life as a dinosaur</h1>
      <main>
          <p>Us dinosaurs like to walk around slowly.
              We like to eat and go to the bathroom all day every day. 
              We're actually not as mean as we might appear.
              However, most of the time we're just looking for a meal.
          </p>
          <p>At night, most of us sleep just like the humans. 
              Others, the weird ones, like to hunt.
          </p>
          <p>We love meeting other dinosaurs and making new friends. 
              We like to gather to sing and dance the night away.
              Each one of us dinosaurs enjoys their life to the fullest.
